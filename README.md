# HAVARD_HEYDAY
This program was made in honor of Auburn University's annual Hey Day. Auburn started this tradition in 1947 to make World War II veterans at AU feel more welcome on campus. You can read more about the tradition here: https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/
This script will ask you for your name and give you a friendly "Hey." Happy Hey Day!
